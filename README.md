# Path_finding_Algo_visualization
This Project is developed to visualize the working of different types of Path Finding Algorithms. This Project is developed by using "NATIVE PYTHON"
# Each cell represents a node and the color of the node represents the status of the cell
-- ORANGE - The start node
-- TURQUOISE   - The end Node
-- PURPLE - The optimal path
-- BLACK  - Barriers
-- RED    - Visited
-- BLUE   - Neighbours
